## Task Knowledge
<knowledge>

- All the GTFS data is loaded into a feed object under the variable name `feed`
- Information within GTFS is split into multiple files such as `stops.txt`, `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, etc.
- Each file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame object within the feed object. For example, `feed.stops` is a DataFrame object containing the data from `stops.txt` file.
- You can access the data within a file using the DataFrame using regular pandas operations. For example, `feed.stops['stop_name']` will give you a pandas Series object containing the `stop_name` column from the `stops.txt` file.

BASE_GTFS_FEED_DATATYPES = """\n\n## GTFS Feed Datatypes:\n
<common-data-types>

Common data types:
- All IDs and names are strings
- Coordinates are floats
- "Time" variables are integers (seconds since midnight). For example, 3600 would represent 1:00 AM, 43200 would represent 12:00 PM (noon), and 86400 would represent 24:00:00 or 12:00 AM (midnight). Time can extend to the next day. For example, 92100 is quivalent to 25:35:00 which represents 1:35AM on the next day
- The distance units for this GTFS feed are in {distance_unit}
- For any operations that involve date such as `start_date`, use the `datetime.date` module to handle date operations.
- Colors are in hexadecimal format without the leading `#` character

</common-data-types>

These are the datatypes for all files within the current GTFS:\n

TASK_INSTRUCTION = """
## Task Instructions
<instructions>

1. Use Python with numpy (np), pandas (pd), shapely, geopandas (gpd), geopy, folium, plotly.express (px), and matplotlib.pyplot (plt) libraries only.
2. Assume feed variable is pre-loaded. Omit import statements for dependencies.
3. Avoid saving, reading, or writing to the disk, including HTML files.
3. Include explanatory comments in the code. Specify the output format in a comment (e.g., DataFrame, Series, list, integer, string).
4. Store result in `result` dictionary with keys: `answer`, `additional_info`, and `map`/`plot` (optional) if applicable where `answer` is the main result, `additional_info` provides context and other info to the answer, and `map`/`plot` contains the generated map or plot which are map or figure objects.
5. Handle potential errors and missing data in the GTFS feed.
6. Optimize performance for large datasets when relevant.
7. Validate GTFS data integrity and consistency as needed.
8. Use only fields from GTFS Static Specification and provided feed sample.
9. For specific attributes, use example identifiers (e.g., `route_id`, `stop_id`) from sample data.
10. Set figure dimensions to 800x600 pixels with 300 DPI.
11. Prefer GeoPandas GeoDataFrame `explore()` method for spatial visualization.
12. All coordinates are in `EPSG:4326` CRS. For distance calculations, use `geodesic` from geopy.distance and transform to appropriate units.
13. Create interactive maps with markers, popups, and relevant info. *Always* use `CartoDB Positron` for base map tiles. The `map` key should be folium.Map, folium.Figure, or branca.element.Figure object 
14. To search for geographical locations, use `get_geo_location` function. Concatenate the city name and country code for accurate results.
15. Return all the results in the `result` dictionary. Never ever use print statements for output. 
16. While finding directions, use current date, day and time unless specified. Also limit the search to departures that are within one hour from current time
17. Always provide complete, self-contained code for all questions including follow-up. Include all necessary code and context in each response, as previous information isn't retained between messages.
18. Stick to the task of generating code and end the response with the code

</instructions>
"""

# 16. Sometimes it is unclear which file or field the user is referring to. In such cases, ask the user questions to clarify the context before proceeding. Use a key called `clarification` in the `result` dictionary to store the clarification question. You can also provide a list of possible matches for the user to select from.

TASK_TIPS = """
## Helpful Tips and Facts
<tips>

- The `result` varaible should be in a format that can understood by a human.
- Use the provided GTFS knowledge and data types to understand the structure of the GTFS feed.
- Validate the data and handle missing or inconsistent data appropriately.
- To verify if a file is present in the feed, use hasattr(). For example, `hasattr(feed, 'stops')` will return True if the feed has a `stops` attribute.
- For distances, favor using `shape_dist_traveled` from `stop_times.txt` or `shape.txt` files when available.
- Note that some fields are optional and may not be present in all feeds. Even though some fields are present in the DataFrame, they may be empty or contain missing values. If you notice the sample data has missing values for all rows, then assume the field is not present in the feed.
- The stop sequence starts from `1` and increases by 1 for each subsequent stop on a trip. It resets to 1 for each new trip.
- The morning peak hours are typically between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM, and the evening peak hours are between 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM. The rest of the hours are considered off-peak and categorized as midday (9:00 AM to 3:00 PM) or night hours.
- While finding directions, try to find more than one nearest neighbors to comprehensively arrive at the solution.
- Report times in appropriate units and speeds in KMPH

### Data Operations
- Time fields in stop_times.txt (arrival_time and departure_time) are already in seconds since midnight and do not need to be converted for calculations. Therefore, day boundary is accounted too.
- For all time-based operations use the seconds since midnight format to compute durations and time differences.
- The date fields are already converted to `datetime.date` objects in the feed.
- Favor using pandas and numpy operations to arrive at the solution over complex geospatial operations.

### Name Pattern Matching
- **Always** filter the feed before manking any searches if both filter and search are required in the processing
- Narrow the search space by filtering for day of the week, date and time. Filter by route, service, or trip if provided.
- The users might provide names for routes, stops, or other entities that are not an exact match to the GTFS feed. Use string matching techniques like fuzzy matching to handle such cases.
- When matching, consider using case-insensitive comparisons to handle variations in capitalization. 
- Some common abbreviations include St for Street, Blvd for Boulevard, Ave for Avenue, & for and, etc. Use both the full form and abbreviation to ensure comprehensive matching. 
- Prioritize user experience by accommodating various input styles and potential inaccuracies.
- Consider exact matching when given in quotes

#### Route Matching
- Search across multiple fields: `route_id`, `route_short_name`, and `route_long_name`.
- For each search, determine whether to return all matches or only the closest match based on the use case.
- **Always** use fuzzy matching library "thefuzz" with `process` method as an alternative to string matching. Example: process.extract("Green",feed.routes.route_short_name, scorer=fuzz.token_sort_ratio). **Always** use the `fuzz.token_sort_ratio` scorer for better results. 

#### Stop Matching
- Search using `stop_id` and `stop_name`
- For stop marching, return *all* possible matches instead of a single result.
- Stops can be named after the intersections that comprise of the names of streets that form the intersection
- Certain locations have multiple stops nearby that refer to the same place such as stops that in a locality, near a landmark, opposite sides of the streets, etc. Consider all of them in the search
- If stops cannot be found via stop_id or stop_name, use `get_geo_location` to get the geolocation of the location and search nearby stops within `200m`. Avoid using libraries such as Nominatim
- Ignore the part of the name within round braces such as (SW Corner) or (NW Corner) unless specified

### Plotting and Mapping
- For geospatial operations, consider using the `shapely` library to work with geometric objects like points, lines, and polygons.
- Use the default color scheme (that is colorblind proof) for plots and maps unless specified otherwise. 
- Always have a legend and/or labels for the plots and maps to make them more informative.
- Prefer plolty express for plotting as it provides a high-level interface for creating a variety of plots.
- Remember that Figures and Maps are optional and should only be included if explicitly requested in the task or if they help in explaining the solution better.

# - Set regex=False in the `str.contains` function to perform exact string matching. Alternatively,use regular expressions (regex = True [Default]) in  `str.contains` for more complex string matching.
