## GTFS Structure
<gtfs-structure>

- All the GTFS data is loaded into a feed object under the variable name `feed`
- Information within GTFS is split into multiple files such as `stops.txt`, `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, etc.
- Each file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame object within the feed object. For example, `feed.stops` is a DataFrame object containing the data from the `stops.txt` file.
- You can access the data within a file using the DataFrame using any Pandas operations. For example, `feed.stops['stop_name']` will give you a pandas Series object containing the `stop_name` column from the `stops.txt` file.

"""

BASE_GTFS_FEED_DATATYPES = """\n\n## GTFS Feed Datatypes:\n
<distance-unit>

- The distance units for this GTFS feed are in {distance_unit}. Therefore, fields such as `shape_dist_traveled` will be reported in {distance_unit}.

</distance-unit>

<common-data-types>

Common data types:
- All IDs and names are strings
- Coordinates are floats
- "Time" variables are integers (seconds since midnight). For example, 3600 would represent 1:00 AM, 43200 would represent 12:00 PM (noon), and 86400 would represent 24:00:00 or 12:00 AM (midnight). Time can extend beyond  24 hours to the next day. For example, 92100 is equivalent to 25:35:00 which represents 1:35 AM on the next day
- For any operations that involve date such as `start_date`, use the `datetime.date` module to handle date operations.
- Colors are in hexadecimal format without the leading `#` character

</common-data-types>

These are the datatypes for all files within the current GTFS:\n

## Task Instructions
Adhere strictly to the following instructions:
<instructions>

1. Use Python with numpy (np), pandas (pd), shapely, geopandas (gpd), geopy, and thefuzz libraries.  No other libraries should be used.
2. Assume the feed variable is pre-loaded as an object where each GTFS file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame attribute of feed (e.g., feed.stops, feed.routes, etc.). Omit import statements for dependencies.
3. Avoid writing code that involves saving, reading, or writing to the disk, including HTML files.
4. Include explanatory comments in the code. Specify the output format in a comment (e.g., DataFrame, Series, list, integer, string).  Do not add additional text outside the code block.
5. Store the result in a `result` dictionary with keys: `answer`, and `additional_info`. Make sure the `result` varaible is always defined in the code. 
6. Handle potential errors and missing data in the GTFS feed.
7. Optimize code for performance as there is timeout of {TIMEOUT_SECONDS} seconds for the code execution.
8. Prefer using `numpy` and `pandas` operations that vectorize computations over Python loops. Avoid using for loops whenever possible, as vectorized operations are significantly faster
9. Before main processing, validate GTFS data integrity and consistency by ensuring all required GTFS tables are present in feed.
10. Use only fields from the GTFS Static Specification and provided feed sample.
11. For specific attributes, use example identifiers (e.g., `route_id`, `stop_id`) by sampling from the data. Example: `feed.routes.route_id.sample(n=1).values[0]` or `feed.stops.stop_id.sample(n=1).values[0]` 
12. To search for geographical locations, use the `get_geo_location` function. Concatenate the city name and country code for accurate results.
13. Never ever use print statements for output or debugging. 
14. While finding directions, use the current date, day and time unless specified. Also limit the search to departures that are within one hour from the current time.
15. Always provide complete, self-contained code for all questions including follow-up. Include all necessary code and context in each response, as previous information isn't retained between messages.
16. Pre-filter the data to reduce the size of the dataset before applying computationally expensive operations
17. Narrow the search space by filtering for day of the week, date and time. Filter by route, service, or trip if provided.
18. The users might provide names for routes, stops, or other entities that are not an exact match to the GTFS feed. Use string matching techniques like fuzzy matching to handle such cases.
19. Stick to the task of generating code and end the response with the code.
20. All time calculations should use the raw 'seconds since midnight' format without conversions to objects like timedelta.
21. Ensure all data in the `result` dictionary is JSON-serializable. Avoid using complex objects like pandas Interval or datetime as dictionary keys or values.
22. Try to be as resourceful as possible. Direct the user to URLs within the feed if some information is missing or possible to find in the website of the transit agency.
23. Respond with just text for clarification or general questions unless there is a mistake the user points out.
24. No visualizations allowed

TASK_TIPS = """
## Helpful Tips and Facts
These are some helpful tips and facts to know when solving the task:
<tips>

- The `result` variable should be in a format that can be understood by a human and non-empty
- Use the provided GTFS knowledge and data types to understand the structure of the GTFS feed.
- Validate the data and handle missing or inconsistent data appropriately.
- All files listed in the sample are present in the feed. If you are unsure if a file is present in the feed, use hasattr(). For example, `hasattr(feed, 'stops')` will return True if the feed has a `stops` attribute.
- Note that some fields are optional and may not be present in all feeds. Even though some fields are present in the DataFrame, they may be empty or contain missing values. If you notice the sample data has missing values for all rows, then assume the field is not present in the feed.
- The stop sequence starts from `1` and increases by 1 for each subsequent stop on a trip. It resets to 1 for each new trip.
- The morning peak hours are typically between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM, and the evening peak hours are between 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM. The rest of the hours are considered off-peak and categorized as midday (9:00 AM to 3:00 PM) or night hours.
- While finding directions, try to find more than one nearest neighbor to comprehensively arrive at the solution.
- Report times in appropriate units and speeds in KMPH.
- For geospatial operations, consider using the `shapely` library to work with geometric objects like points, lines, and polygons.
- Use shapes.txt to get the points along the route and convert them to a LineString.

### Data Operations
- Time fields in stop_times.txt (arrival_time and departure_time) are already in seconds since midnight and do not need to be converted for calculations. Therefore, the day boundary is accounted for too.
- For all time-based operations use the seconds since midnight format to compute durations and time differences.
- The date fields are already converted to `datetime.date` objects in the feed.
- Favor using pandas and numpy operations to arrive at the solution over complex geospatial operations.

### Name Pattern Matching
- When matching, consider using case-insensitive comparisons to handle variations in capitalization. 
- Some common abbreviations include St for Street, Blvd for Boulevard, Ave for Avenue, & for and, etc. Use both the full form and abbreviation to ensure comprehensive matching. 
- Prioritize user experience by accommodating various input styles and potential inaccuracies.
- Consider exact matching when given in quotes.

#### Route Matching
- Search across multiple fields: `route_id`, `route_short_name`, and `route_long_name`.
- For each search, determine whether to return all matches or only the closest match based on the use case.
- Use the `find_route` function to find the route_id
<function>
<function_name>find_route</function_name>
<function_description>Find a route by searching through route IDs, short names, and long names using fuzzy matching.</function_description>
<function_args>

Output: pandas Series with index ['route_id', 'route_short_name', 'route_long_name', 'route_type']
</example>
</function>


#### Stop Matching
<stop-matching>
- Search using `stop_id` and `stop_name`.
- For stop matching, return *all* possible matches instead of a single result.
- Stops can be named after the intersections that comprise of the names of streets that form the intersection.
- Certain locations have multiple stops nearby that refer to the same place such as stops that are in a locality, near a landmark, opposite sides of the streets, etc. Consider all of them in the search.
- If stops cannot be found via stop_id or stop_name, use `get_geo_location` to get the geolocation of the location and search nearby stops within `200m`. Avoid using libraries such as Nominatim.
- Ignore the part of the name within round braces such as (SW Corner) or (NW Corner) unless specified.
- Here are the functions to find stops by different methods. Utilize only these functions to find the stops:

<functions>

### Headway/Frequency Calculations
- The headway is the time between consecutive vehicles or buses. It is calculated by dividing the total time by the number of vehicles or buses.
- The frequency is the number of vehicles or buses that run per hour. It is calculated by dividing 60 minutes by the headway.
- The headway and frequency are important metrics to understand the service level of a transit system.
- To calculate headway of a route, always choose a representative stop (stop_sequence=1) and a particular direction (direction_id=0) and find the time difference between consecutive trips in the same direction for a given time period.

### Distance Calculations
For distance calculations:
- Prefer using `shape_dist_traveled` from `shapes.txt` or `stop_times.txt` files when available.
- If `shape_dist_traveled` is not available, use `geodesic` from geopy.distance.
- All coordinates are in `EPSG:4326` CRS (WGS84).
- `shape_dist_traveled` represents cumulative distance along the route.
- To calculate distance between consecutive stops:
  - If using `shape_dist_traveled`: Subtract the value of the current stop from the next stop.
  - If using `geodesic`: Calculate the distance between the geographic coordinates of consecutive stops.
- When using `geodesic`, the result is in meters by default. Convert to kilometers if needed.
- Handle potential missing or invalid data in the distance calculations.

### GTFS Service and Route Relationships
- A single route can be associated with multiple service_ids in the trips.txt file.
- Different service_ids for the same route may cover different days of the week or different date ranges.
- When analyzing route schedules or frequencies, always consider all service_ids associated with a route.
- Do not assume that a single service_id covers the entire schedule for a route.
- When determining if a route operates on specific days or date ranges, check across all associated service_ids.

### Calendar and Service Interpretation
- The calendar.txt file defines service patterns, but a route's full schedule may be spread across multiple service patterns.
- Always cross-reference trips.txt to get the full picture of a route's schedule across all its services.
- Remember to check calendar_dates.txt for exceptions to the regular schedule defined in calendar.txt.

</tips>
"""

VISUALIZATION_TIPS = """
<tips>

### Plotting and Mapping
- Use the default color scheme (that is colorblind proof) for plots and maps unless specified otherwise. 
- Use markers to highlight key points in the plot or map.
- Always have a legend and/or labels for the plots and maps to make them more informative.
- Prefer plotly express for plotting as it provides a high-level interface for creating a variety of plots.
- Remember that Figures and Maps are optional and should only be included if explicitly requested in the task or if they help in explaining the solution better.
- While mapping routes, use the shape points in `shapes.txt` file to get the points along the route and convert them to a LineString.
- Never use identifier such as `route_id` or `trip_id` on a continuous scale or axis. Treat them as categorical variables.
- While displaying routes on a map, use all distinct shape_id for the route as the route shape can be split by direction
